\subsection{Chess with Friends}\href{https://github.com/xl4624/chess-with-friends}{\fontsize{14pt}{14pt}\selectfont\faGithub} \\
\technologies{Python, Flask, JavaScript, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Docker} \\
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Led a team of 3 to develop an online multiplayer chess website where users can challenge others by sharing a link
    \item Implemented real-time updates to the chessboard and move history table after a player makes a move using Flask and Socket.IO and added an interactive chat for players to communicate during a match using JavaScript and HTML
    \item Directed project management efforts by delegating tasks among team members, conducting code reviews, and documenting/testing the codebase
\end{tightemize}

\subsection{Debugging Memory Allocator} \\
\technologies{C++} \\
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Created a custom memory allocator using C++ that supports malloc, free, and realloc functions while reporting on memory leaks and preventing buffer overflows via canaries
    \item Utilized a linear, sorted free list with metadata headers to manage memory blocks and implemented methods for splitting oversized freed memory blocks and coalescing adjacent blocks using pointer arithmetic
\end{tightemize}

\subsection{sudo ku}\href{https://github.com/xl4624/sudo-ku}{\fontsize{14pt}{14pt}\selectfont\faGithub} \\
\technologies{Go, JSON, HTTP} \\
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a CLI web scraper that fetches the latest Sudoku puzzles from \href{https://sudoku.com.au/}{\underline{sudoku.au}} and solves them in \textasciitilde1ms using a depth-first search backtracking algorithm prioritizing the most constraining cell with the fewest legal moves 
\end{tightemize}

\subsection{COVID-19 Visualization}\href{https://github.com/xl4624/covid-visualization}{\fontsize{14pt}{14pt}\selectfont\faGithub} \\
\technologies{Python, pandas, Matplotlib} \\
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Analyzed and visualized COVID-19 data from the CDC COVID Data Tracker using pandas and Matplotlib to create a choropleth map that tracks the number of cases and deaths in the United States as the pandemic progressed
